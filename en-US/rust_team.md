# The Rust Team

Rust has a community-driven development process where most decisions are made
through open discussion and consensus, under the stewardship of various
[teams][teams]:

* The [Core Team][core_team] is responsible for steering the design and
development process, overseeing the introduction of new features, and ultimately
making decisions for which there is no consensus (this happens rarely).

* The [Language Design Team][language_team] is responsible for the
  design of new language features.

* The [Library Team][library_team] is responsible for the Rust standard
library, rust-lang crates, and conventions.

* The [Compiler Team][compiler_team] is responsible for compiler internals and
optimizations.

* The [Tooling and Infrastructure Team][tool_team] is responsible for official
tools like [Cargo], [rustup], and [rustfmt], as well as the CI Infrastructure for the
project.

[Cargo]: https://crates.io
[rustup]: https://www.rustup.rs
[rustfmt]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt

* The [Community Team][community_team] is responsible for coordinating events,
outreach, commercial users, teaching materials, and exposure. They can also
direct inquiries to the correct parties when its not clear who to contact
about something Rusty.

* The [Moderation Team][mod_team] is responsible for helping to uphold the
[code of conduct][coc].

* The [Documentation Team][doc_team] is responsible for ensuring Rust has
  fantastic documentation.

In addition to the official team rosters, most teams also have a larger set
of reviewers who are knowledgeable about the area and can sign off on
code. If you're interested in getting involved in one of these teams,
feel free to reach out to the team leader or any other member, who can
help get you started.
