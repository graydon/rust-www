# The Rust Community

The Rust programming language has many qualities, but Rust's greatest
strength is the community of people who come together to make working
in Rust a rewarding experience.

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal
characteristic. Our [code of conduct][coc] sets the standards for
behavior in all official Rust forums.

If you feel you have been or are
being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please
[contact][mod_team_email] any of the [Rust Moderation Team][mod_team]
immediately. Whether you are a regular contributor or a newcomer, we
care about making the community a safe space for you.

  loves answering questions at any depth.
