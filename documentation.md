# Getting Started  <a name="getting_started"></a>

If you haven't seen Rust at all yet, the first thing you should read
is the introduction to [The Rust Programming Language][rustbook]. It'll
give you a good idea of what Rust is like.

The book provides a lengthy explanation of Rust, its syntax, and its
concepts. Upon completing the book, you'll be an intermediate Rust
developer, and will have a good grasp of the fundamental ideas behind
Rust.

[Rust By Example][rust_by_example] was originally a community
resource, but was then donated to the Rust project. As the name
implies, it teaches you Rust through a series of small examples.

# The Standard Library<a name="standard_library"></a>

We have [API documentation][rustdocs] for the entire standard library. There's a
list of crates on the left with more specific sections, or you can use
the search bar at the top to search for something if you know its
name.

# Community &amp; Getting Help <a name="community_and_help"></a>

If you need help with something, or just want to talk about Rust with
others, there are a few places you can do that:

The Rust IRC channels on [irc.mozilla.org][irc_mozilla] are the
fastest way to get help.

\#rust is the general discussion channel, and you'll find people
willing to help you with any questions you may have.

There are also three specialty channels:
\#rust-gamedev and #rust-osdev are for game development and operating
system development, respectively. There's also #rust-internals, which
is for discussion of the development of Rust itself.

You can also get help on [Stack Overflow][stack_overflow]. Searching
for your problem might reveal someone who has asked it before!

There is an active [subreddit][reddit] with lots of discussion and
news about Rust.

There is also a [user forum][user_forum], for all user-oriented
discussion, and a [developer forum][developer_forum], where the
development of Rust itself is discussed.

[irc_mozilla]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC
[stack_overflow]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust
[reddit]: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/
[user_forum]: https://users.rust-lang.org/
[developer_forum]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/

# Specification<a name="specification"></a>

Rust does not have an exact specification, but an effort to describe as much of
the language in as much detail as possible is in [the Reference][reference]</a>.

[reference]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference.html

# Tools<a name="tools"></a>
Rust is still a young language, so there isn't a ton of tooling yet,
but the tools we have are really nice.

[Cargo][cargo] is Rust's package manager, and its website contains
lots of good documentation.

[cargo]: https://crates.io

[Rustdoc][rustdoc] is used to generate documentation for Rust code.

[rustdoc]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/documentation.html

# FAQs<a name="faqs"></a>

There are questions that are asked quite often, so we've made a FAQ for
them:

- [FAQ][faq]

[faq]: "faq.md"

# The Error Index<a name="error_index"></a>

If you encounter an error while compiling your code you may be able to
look it up in the [Rust Compiler Error Index][error_index].

[error_index]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html

# Community Translations<a name="translations"></a>

Several projects have been started to translate the documentation into other
languages:


- [Russian][russian_translation]
- [Korean][korean_translation]
- [Chinese][chinese_translation]
- [Spanish][spanish_translation]
