# Rust Development

Rust has had over [1,200 different contributors][authors], a number that grows
every single week. [We'd love for you to join that list][contribute]!

As mentioned above, the [Rust Internals Forum][internals_forum] is dedicated to
discussing the design and implementation of Rust. A lot of discussion also
happens on GitHub:

- The [main repository][github] and [issue tracker][issue_tracking] are the
  front lines of the implementation work. Our reviewers strive to be friendly
  and to help mentor newcomers, so don't hesitate to open a pull request!

- The [RFC repo][rfcs] tracks our Request for Comment process, the main pathway
  through which the Rust community and the teams reach consensus on new
  features proposed for the language and official libraries and tools.

Roughly weekly, the Rust teams produce [team reports][team_reports] tracking
team business, including the progression of proposals through the RFC and
implementation process.
