# Rust user logos

# If you are a "production" user of Rust, you are encouraged to add
# your organization's information here to have it displayed on and
# linked from the Rust web page. Organizations are listed
# alphabetically.

# The 'how' field should be one short sentence, ideally with a link
# providing evidence (other prospective users will be interested to
# know details). The UI for this can't accomodate more than about two
# lines of text.

# To have your pull request accepted, you must additionally provide us
# the name and email of a contact within your organization who the
# Rust team can contact should we need to make changes to the web
# page. You may either do this on the pull request itself, or
# alternately email user-logos@rust-lang.org with the subject line
# "Rust User Logo Contact". This information will be kept private.

# Logos will be displayed against a white background and constrained
# via CSS to a width of 200px by 100px. To support high-resolution
# displays, consider submitting your image at a resolution of at least
# 400px by 200px.
